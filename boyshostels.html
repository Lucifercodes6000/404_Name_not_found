                <p>There are a total of 20 men's hostels in VIT (air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned). The R block is an apartment-style hostel where each wing has its own separate washroom. The S and T blocks are deluxe blocks, while the Q block is semi-deluxe and also serves as the freshers' block. The blocks allotted to freshers change periodically, with the exception of Q block. Freshers are mostly allotted P and E blocks (non-air-conditioned), while K and L blocks have bunker beds and M and N blocks have wooden 3-bedded and 2-bedded rooms.</p>

The laundry service provided in the men's hostel is facilitated through a mobile application called "Chota Dhobi." This app is accessible on both Android and iOS platforms. Initially, each hosteller is entitled to 44 complimentary laundry services, and the count is maintained within the app. For residents residing in Blocks K and E, the primary laundry facility is conveniently located near Enzo. Residents in Blocks L, M, Q, and R have the advantage of having their own dedicated laundry facilities within their respective hostels. It is important to note that while any laundry bag can be utilized, it is not mandatory to purchase a laundry bag specifically from Chota Dhobi. Additionally, there is a paid laundry service available beside the hostel office, and a tailor is available behind Enzo in the indoor sports complex.
