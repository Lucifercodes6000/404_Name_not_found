                <P>The minimum number of credits that can be registered is 16 and maximum is 27 .But the actual number depends upon the number of courses offered by your respective school </P>
                <p>YOU WILL HAVE FFCS FOR THE NEXT SEMESTER i.e (WINTER SEMESTER)</p>
                <p>You can choose between different faculties,different slots and different venues as well.</p>
                <P>The slots are as follows (A,B,C,D,E,F,G)and respective T slots.</P>
